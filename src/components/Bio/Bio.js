          This is my Bio, About me and photo of me... area. It's hard for me to
          sum myself up in a direct way. The reason it is so difficult is
          because I still learn new things and new things about myself.

        <p>
          Things I have found that I enjoy: Ridding my bicycle, playing my
          guitar, playing table top games (aka board games) and some video
          games, I also love to homebrew, cook, bake, family, friends and a good
          brain teaser.
        </p>
        <p>
        
          It's the brain teaser part, and logic puzzles that I found that I
          really enjoyed learning to code. I have enjoyed all the spare time I
          put into it that I joined University of Oregon's Coding Boot Camp to
          see if I could make a career out of it.

          While this react profile is a requirement to complete a homework, I
          plan to come back after the boot camp and continue to add to it.
